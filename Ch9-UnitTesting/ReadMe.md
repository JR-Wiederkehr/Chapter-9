Unit Testing using CMake and Google Test

No additonal software is needed unless you plan to modify my code, in which case you need CMake version 3.28.3 or greater. Please edit the cmake.cmakepath variable inside settings.json in the .vscode folder.

The test executable is located in the build folder, "testSuite.exe". This executable does not pause, so please pipe the results elsewhere, or run the executable in a terminal.
